Work-in-progress on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) directives to support [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com) modules.

###About

This is in extremely early stages currently, and will likely not get very far without your help!

Please, fork, pick a module, implement it and provide as many thoroughly rigid (or not so rigid, whatever) tests as you can. It will be awesome, trust me.

Let us work together to turn Semantic-UI into a truely semantic framework with AngularJS directives bringing the markup to life.

###Dependencies

- Semantic-UI
